              <h2>Detailed Professional History</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Throughout his forensic career, Stephen has analyzed over a thousand cases and participated in hundreds
              of death investigations, including homicides, suicides, officer-involved shootings, autopsies, and
              custodial deaths. Most recently, he served for ten years as a Criminalist with the San Diego County
              Sheriff’s Department, specializing in Forensic Biology, Forensic Firearms Analysis, and Crime Scene
              Investigation and Reconstruction.</p>
            <p>Stephen also spent six years as a contract assessor and trainer with the National Forensic Science
              Technology Center (now FIU Global Forensic and Justice Center), where he performed DNA laboratory audits
              and taught courses on DNA amplification, likelihood ratios, and population statistics. Prior to that,
              Stephen worked with the Arizona Department of Public Safety, performing casework in Forensic Biology, and
              the California Department of Justice’s Richmond DNA Lab, where he contributed to the FBI’s Combined DNA
              Index System (CODIS).</p>
            <p>Over his career, Stephen has completed more than 2,000 hours of professional training in areas such as
              Forensic Biology, Forensic Firearms Analysis, Trajectory Analysis, Bloodstain Pattern Analysis, and
              courtroom testimony. He has testified as an expert witness in superior courts in Arizona and California,
              and in federal court for the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Stephen's
              courtroom experience has been noted for his ability to explain complex scientific concepts in an
              understandable and engaging way for juries and attorneys alike.</p>
            <p>In addition to his forensic science work, Stephen served as the Regional Director South for the
              California Association of Criminalists (CAC), where he organized regional study groups and hosted
              presentations by experts, including a keynote address by Jeff Udvarhelyi, an Escondido Police Department
              Child Abuse Detective, on a significant child abuse case. As the Lead Webmaster for the CAC, he enhanced
              the organization’s public presence by overhauling its website for better communication and engagement.</p>
            <p>Before his career in forensics, Stephen worked for six years as a published research scientist. Under Dr.
              Michael Wells at the University of Arizona, he studied protease regulation in the Yellow Fever mosquito,
              <i>Aedes aegypti</i>. He also completed an internship at the National Institutes of Health/NIDDK, studying
              neutral lipid trafficking in Niemann-Pick Type C disease under Dr. E. Joan Blanchette-Mackie.
            </p>
            <p>Stephen holds an Executive MBA with Honors from Quantic School of Business and Technology and a Bachelor
              of Science with Honors, <i>magna cum laude</i>, in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Molecular and
              Cellular Biology from the University of Arizona. Stephen is a Society for Human Resource Management
              Certified Professional (SHRM-CP). In addition, he is a member of Phi Beta Kappa, an honor society
              recognizing exceptional academic achievements in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and
              mathematics.</p>
            <p>Since retiring from active casework, Stephen has shifted his focus towards leadership development in
              forensic science. He founded the Forensic Leaders Training Center®, where he provided online leadership
              and management training for forensic professionals, helping them to advance their careers and improve
              workplace culture. Stephen's interest in leadership and public education is further reflected in his
              recent book, <i>CSI to CEO</i>, where he covers forensic science topics such as DNA analysis, crime scene
              investigation, bloodstain pattern analysis, and forensic leadership for a general audience. In 2023,
              Stephen had the honor of graduating from the FBI San Diego's Citizens Academy as a demonstration of his
              continued dedication to public service.</p>
            <p>Stephen volunteers his time and resources to support and improve the lives of people living with
              Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). He is a community member of UC San Diego Health's Patient and Family
              Advisory Council, working to unify patients, family, and team members to enhance the experience for
              everyone, evaluate strategies and improve quality and safety outcomes.</p>
            <p>In his free time, Stephen enjoys reading and writing, web development, electronic music composition and
              production, and playing with Aries, a stubborn Siberian Husky.</p>
